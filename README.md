**Implementation Details**</br>
The game is implemented in Java, using simple console input/output operations. </br>
The Game.java file contains the main game loop, which handles player input and updates the game state after each move.

The game state is stored in a two-dimensional array of characters, 
representing the current state of each space on the board. A value of '_' (space) indicates an empty space, 
while a value of 'X' or 'O' represents a mark by player X or player O, respectively.

The game logic is implemented in the Game.java file, </br>
which contains methods for checking if a player has won, checking if the game has ended in a tie, and updating the game state after each move.</br></br>
